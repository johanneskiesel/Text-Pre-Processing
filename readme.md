# Text Preprocessing

## Description
The method performs necessary text preprocessing functions that are necessary before using the data for a downstream task. The method offer multiple preprocessing functions i.e., text tokenization, text lemmatization, remove stopwords, and document documents into sentences 

## Use Cases

- **Survey Response Analysis:** Social scientists can preprocess open-ended survey responses to clean and standardize text, making it easier to identify common themes and perform quantitative text analysis.

- **Interview Transcript Preparation:** By removing stopwords and lemmatizing words in interview transcripts, researchers can focus on the core content, facilitating qualitative coding and thematic analysis.

- **Social Media Data Mining:** The Method's techniques help in cleaning and structuring social media posts, enabling sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and trend detection in large-scale digital communication datasets.

## Input Data

1. This function simplifies choosing the appropriate spaCy language model based on the input language code.

```python
model = choose_spacy_model('en')  # Choose spaCy English model
```

This method operates on any text corpus of textual data. Please make sure to load a spacy model that fits your language.

2. Tokenizes the input text using spaCy, as a list of tokens.

```python
text = "This is a sample text."
tokens = tokenize_text(text)
print(tokens)
# Output: ['This', 'is', 'a', 'sample', 'text', '.']
```
## Output Data
Removes stopwords from the input text using spaCy, returning a list of tokens without stopwords.

```python
text = "Remove these stopwords from the text."
filtered_tokens = remove_stopwords(text)
print(filtered_tokens)
# Output: ['Remove', 'stopwords', 'text', '.']
```

Lemmatizes the input text using spaCy, providing a list of lemmatized tokens.

```python
text = "Lemmatize this text."
lemmatized_tokens = lemmatize_text(text)
print(lemmatized_tokens)
# Output: ['lemmatize', 'this', 'text', '.']
```

Text segmented into sentences using spaCy.

```python
text = "This is a sample text. Remove these stopwords from the text. Lemmatize this text."
list_of_sentences = split_sentences(text)
print(list_of_sentences)
# Output: ['This is a sample text.', 'Remove these stopwords from the text.', 'Lemmatize this text.']
```

*Note:* Please explore ```pre_processing.ipynb``` for more functions.

## Hardware Requirements
The method runs on a cheap virtual machine provided by cloud computing company (2 x86 CPU core, 4 GB RAM, 40GB HDD).

## Environment Setup

1. Please install Python 3.10 or higher if you haven't already. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the necessary spaCy language model. For example, for English, you can run:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## How to use

To use the provided functions, simply import them into your Python script or Jupyter notebook as shown above. You can chain the functions together for a complete text pre-processing pipeline, for example:

```python
text = "Text pre-processing is essential for NLP tasks."
tokens = tokenize_text(text)
filtered_tokens = remove_stopwords(' '.join(tokens))
lemmatized_tokens = lemmatize_text(' '.join(filtered_tokens))
print(lemmatized_tokens)
```

Import the functions
```python
from pre_processing import *
```
