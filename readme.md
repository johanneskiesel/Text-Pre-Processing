# Text Preprocessing

## Learning Objective

This tutorial will teach you the essential techniques for text pre-processing using Python and spaCy, with a focus on practical applications in social science research. You will learn how to clean, structure, and transform raw text dataâ€”making it ready for analysis, modeling, and interpretation.

Text pre-processing is a critical first step in any Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflow. By mastering these methods, you will be able to:
- Remove noise and inconsistencies from textual data
- Standardize and normalize language for better analysis
- Extract meaningful information for downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and entity recognition

Whether you are working with survey responses, interview transcripts, or social media data, these skills will help you unlock deeper insights and make your research

## Use Cases

- **Survey Response Analysis:** Social scientists can preprocess open-ended survey responses to clean and standardize text, making it easier to identify common themes and perform quantitative text analysis.

- **Interview Transcript Preparation:** By removing stopwords and lemmatizing words in interview transcripts, researchers can focus on the core content, facilitating qualitative coding and thematic analysis.

- **Social Media Data Mining:** The Method's techniques help in cleaning and structuring social media posts, enabling sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and trend detection in large-scale digital communication datasets.

## Target Audience

This project is designed for:

- **Social Scientists and Researchers:**  
  Who want to analyze qualitative data from surveys, interviews, or media sources using modern NLP techniques.

- **Students and Educators:**  
  Looking for a practical introduction to text pre-processing and its applications in social science research.

- **Data Analysts and Practitioners:**  
  Interested in cleaning, structuring, and extracting insights from large volumes of textual data.

- **Anyone New to NLP:**  
  The step-by-step notebook and clear code examples make it accessible for beginners with basic Python knowledge.

No prior experience with spaCy or advanced machine learning is required. The tutorial guides you through each concept, making it easy to apply these techniques to your own

## Environment Setup

1. **Install Python**  
   Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Packages**  
   Install all dependencies using the requirements file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download spaCy Language Model**  
   For English, run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```
   *Tip: Replace `en_core_web_sm` with the appropriate model for your language if needed.*

4. **Ready to Go!**  
   You can now open `pre-processing.ipynb` and start exploring the text pre-processing

## Input Data

1. This function simplifies choosing the appropriate spaCy language model based on the input language code.

```python
model = choose_spacy_model('en')  # Choose spaCy English model
```

This method operates on any text corpus of textual data. Please make sure to load a spacy model that fits your language.

2. Tokenizes the input text using spaCy, as a list of tokens.

```python
text = "This is a sample text."
tokens = tokenize_text(text)
print(tokens)
# Output: ['This', 'is', 'a', 'sample', 'text', '.']
```
## Output Data
Removes stopwords from the input text using spaCy, returning a list of tokens without stopwords.

```python
text = "Remove these stopwords from the text."
filtered_tokens = remove_stopwords(text)
print(filtered_tokens)
# Output: ['Remove', 'stopwords', 'text', '.']
```

Lemmatizes the input text using spaCy, providing a list of lemmatized tokens.

```python
text = "Lemmatize this text."
lemmatized_tokens = lemmatize_text(text)
print(lemmatized_tokens)
# Output: ['lemmatize', 'this', 'text', '.']
```

Text segmented into sentences using spaCy.

```python
text = "This is a sample text. Remove these stopwords from the text. Lemmatize this text."
list_of_sentences = split_sentences(text)
print(list_of_sentences)
# Output: ['This is a sample text.', 'Remove these stopwords from the text.', 'Lemmatize this text.']
```

*Note:* Please explore ```pre_processing.ipynb``` for more functions.

## Hardware Requirements
The method runs on a small virtual machine provided by cloud computing company (2 x86 CPU core, 4 GB RAM, 40GB HDD).

## How to Use

The recommended way to explore and use text pre-processing functions is through the interactive Jupyter notebook:  
**Location:** `pre-processing.ipynb`

- Open the notebook for step-by-step explanations, code examples, and hands-on demonstrations of all techniques.
- Each section is clearly marked and includes sample code you can run and modify.

For direct integration into your own Python scripts, you can also use the module:  
**Location:** `pre_processing.py`

- Import functions as needed:  
  ```python
  from pre_processing import *
  ```

**Tip:** Start with the notebook to understand the workflow, then use the Python file for automation or production tasks.

## Technical Details

### Why Text Pre-Processing?

Raw text data is often noisy, inconsistent, and difficult to analyze directly. Before applying any Natural Language Processing (NLP) or machine learning techniques, it is essential to clean and standardize the text. Pre-processing helps remove irrelevant information, normalize word forms, and structure the data, making downstream analysis more accurate and meaningful.

### What Problems Are We Solving?

This tutorial addresses common challenges in text analysis, such as:
- Handling unstructured and messy text from surveys, interviews, or social media.
- Reducing vocabulary size and improving consistency through lemmatization.
- Removing stopwords and irrelevant tokens to focus on meaningful content.
- Segmenting documents into sentences for finer-grained analysis.
- Extracting entities, keywords, and sentiment for deeper insights.

### How Does the Tutorial Help?

By following the step-by-step notebook, users will learn how to:
- Set up their environment and load spaCy language models.
- Apply essential pre-processing functions (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, sentence segmentation).
- Use advanced techniques like named entity recognition, TF-IDF keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, and vocabulary comparison.
- Understand the impact of each technique on real-world social science data.

The tutorial is designed for both beginners and experienced researchers, providing clear explanations and practical code examples.
