    "## Social Science Use Cases for Text Pre-Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Text pre-processing is a crucial step in social science research, enabling scholars to analyze large volumes of qualitative data efficiently and accurately. Here are some practical applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Survey and Interview Analysis:**  \n",
    "  Automatically extract key themes, sentiments, and entities from open-ended survey responses or interview transcripts. For example, lemmatization and stopword removal help in identifying the most frequent topics discussed by participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Political Discourse Analysis:**  \n",
    "  Tokenization, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis can be used to study political speeches, debates, or social media posts. Researchers can track how politicians discuss certain issues, measure emotional tone, and identify key actors or organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Media and News Studies:**  \n",
    "  Use sentence segmentation and TF-IDF keyword extraction to compare coverage of events across different news outlets. Named entity recognition helps in mapping relationships between people, places, and organizations mentioned in articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparative Linguistic Studies:**  \n",
    "  Vocabulary comparison functions allow researchers to analyze language differences between demographic groups, regions, or time periods. This is useful for studying language evolution, cultural trends, or the impact of policy changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Public Opinion and Sentiment Tracking:**  \n",
    "  Sentiment analysis provides insights into public attitudes toward policies, social issues, or brands by analyzing social media, forums, or feedback forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying these techniques, social scientists can transform unstructured text into actionable data, uncover hidden patterns, and support evidence-based decision-making in"

    "In this tutorial, we explored a comprehensive set of text pre-processing techniques using Python, spaCy, and scikit-learn. Starting from basic tokenization and stopword removal, we progressed through lemmatization, sentence segmentation, named entity recognition, and keyword extraction with TF-IDF. We also covered sentiment analysis, text statistics, and vocabulary comparison between texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "These foundational steps are essential for preparing and analyzing textual data in any Natural Language Processing (NLP) project. By mastering these techniques, you can unlock deeper insights from your data, improve the performance of downstream models, and make your analyses more robust and interpretable.\n",
